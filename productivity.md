# Daily Routines
- [Daniel Ek](https://www.balancethegrind.com.au/daily-routines/daniel-ek-daily-routine/) So, this will sound incredibly lazy compared to some leaders. I wake up at around 6:30 in the morning and spend some time with my kids and wife. At 7:30, I go work out. At 8:30, I go for a walk – even in the winter. I’ve found this is often where I do my best thinking. At 9:30, I read for thirty minutes to an hour. Sometimes I read the news, but you’ll also find an ever-rotating stack of books in my office, next to my bed, on tables around the house. Books on history, leadership, biographies. It’s a pretty eclectic mix – much like my taste in music. Finally, my “work” day really starts at 10:30.

# How To Plan Week

- **Pick one day of the week to hold all of your recurring internal meetings**  For the last twenty years, every Monday I hold a one-on-one meeting with each of my direct reports. Sometimes they only last 10 minutes, other times up to an hour. I’m always asking what happened big last week, what’s big on this week’s agenda, review key metrics and how can I help. This Monday internal check-in theme actually saves me time as it reduces miscommunication and mistakes, holds people to weekly accountability, and eliminates all those “got a minute” meetings.
- **Pick one day a week to ban all internal meetings** In an interview for my book, Dustin Moskovitz, the co-founder of team productivity app Asana, shared his policy of “No Meeting Wednesdays”. It’s the one day a week dedicated to creating, making and doing—not meeting.
- **Pick one day a week to be Administration Day** This is the day to fill out expense reports, complete performance reviews, read committee reports, catch up on old emails, and to schedule any random meetings that aren’t directly related to your key objectives.
- **Pick one day a week to focus on your customers (whether internal or external)** Common advice from successful CEOs is to get out of the office. Make some phone calls, take your top customers to lunch, and listen to the feedback they’re giving you.

# Other Productivity Tips
- “If I have a call or another meeting, I’ll just block it out if I’m in the zone,” he told Fast Company. “That’s unorthodox because it means that you’re breaking social contracts, you’re disappointing someone because you didn’t show up. But if you’re really, really focused, those are the times when the breakthroughs come.” - Daniel Elk
